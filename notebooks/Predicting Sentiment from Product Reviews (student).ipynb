    "* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the **accuracy** of the model.\n",

The difficulty arises as the sentiment model puts too much weight on extremely rare words. A way to rectify this is to apply regularization, to be covered in Module 4.
